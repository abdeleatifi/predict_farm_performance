Yield prediction:
learn to work with pcse or other simulation models

 **************************************
Loss estimation or ditection:
code to download sentinel2 images and return a timeseries ndvi data
collect data about location, type, date and the actual yield that each crop produced and assamble all the data (ndvi timeseries + yield loss + crop location + date +...)
train a model to predict the actual loss caused by human, animals, pests, deseases ...
***************************************
Credit scorer:
collect the predected yield and the actual loss for each farmer's crop that you want to calculat his credit score 
add to the 3rd layer of the network that we built and proced the calculation
**************************************
deploye the model:
